# <div align="center"> Hobbes </div>

Hobbes is a work-in-progress chess engine written in Python.

It is the sequel to my other chess engine, [Calvin](https://github.com/kelseyde/calvin-chess-engine).

My motivations for starting a new chess engine are threefold:

1. To learn Python.
2. To design an NNUE-based engine from the ground up. Hobbes will have no hand-crafted eval, and his neural network will be trained on games generated entirely via self-play.
3. To re-unite Calvin with his best friend :slightly_smiling_face:
